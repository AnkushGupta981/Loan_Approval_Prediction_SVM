## Loan Approval Prediction using SVM

### Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant demographic and financial features.

### Objectives
- Analyze factors influencing loan approval  
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Train and evaluate an SVM classifier  

### Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

### Model Pipeline
- Missing value treatment  
- Categorical encoding  
- Feature scaling  
- SVM model training with RBF kernel  

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy score  
- Precision & Recall  
- Confusion Matrix  

### Key Findings
- Credit history is the strongest approval predictor  
- Income and loan amount influence decisions  
- SVM achieved balanced classification performance
